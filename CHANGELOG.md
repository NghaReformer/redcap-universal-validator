# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — scaffold

Initial standalone REDCap external module extracted from the JavaScript-Injector
script.

- Config-driven client validation on data-entry forms and surveys (no code
  pasting, no JavaScript Injector dependency).
- Repeatable per-rule settings: field type (single/pooled), fields, method,
  payload source, format pattern, separators, expected pool size, and per-rule
  enforcement (informational / advisory / compulsory).
- `js/engine.js` vendored from the `qrcode_generation` combined validator, config
  now injected by the module.
- `php/CheckCharacter.php`: PHP port of all 11 check-character algorithms for the
  server-side `redcap_save_record` guard.
- Parity harness: `tests/parity_js.cjs` (JS, 420/420 green) and
  `tests/parity_php.php` (PHP) against the shared Python-generated fixture; CI in
  `.github/workflows/parity.yml`.

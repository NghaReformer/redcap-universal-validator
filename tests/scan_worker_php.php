/**
 * scan_worker_php.php — the durable scan's state machine and worker.
 *
 * Two things are checked here that nothing else can check:
 *
 *   THE WHOLE TRANSITION MATRIX, not a handful of interesting cases. Every one
 *   of the 49 (from, to) pairs is asserted against a table written out by hand
 *   below. That table is a second, independent statement of the same rule, so a
 *   change to ScanPhase that the author believed was equivalent has to be made
 *   twice before it can pass — the differential technique this repository
 *   already uses to hold the PHP and JavaScript engines together.
 *
 *   THE PLAN'S DERIVATION TABLE, transcribed row for row. tests/scan_security_
 *   php.php checks ScanOutcome::derive() case by case in prose; this file checks
 *   it as the table the plan states, with all five columns at once. A change
 *   that satisfies one prose check while breaking a row of the specification
 *   fails here.
 *
 * Run:  php tests/scan_worker_php.php
